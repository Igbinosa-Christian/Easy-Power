# Easy-Shutdown
From my experience, sometimes shutting down your computer might be stressful becuase you have to type a shortcut, hold down the power button or go into the windows tab. 
So I thought about this Python Program to get the job done with just a click.

Currently, you'll need to have Python Installed to run the program so roadmap:
- Convert Program to exe file.
- Create an exe to reboot.
- Migrate to other OS.
